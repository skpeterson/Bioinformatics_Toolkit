# Sara's Bioinformatics Toolkit

So, you've decided that data is cool. You've decided that big data is even cooler. You've even decided that big data applied to biology is the coolest. And now, you're thinking, I would really like to start learning how to gain biological insight from big data. Welcome to the field of Bioinformatics! I'm happy you're here.

This repository is a slowly growing collection of bits and bobs of information that have helped me on my journey to becoming a bioinformatician. Nothing is novel, nothing is terribly exciting, but it is all useful (to me, at least; I'll let you decide what it is for you). This is intended to be a place where I keep notes of things I've learned and in some way, synthesizing information into the form that is most useful for me to reference when I can't remember how to do something.

Current topics include:
high_performance_computing - a place where you can learn how to use Longleaf, UNC's HPC, and how to submit jobs to Longleafs fair resouce manager, SLURM
linux_basics - a home to learn about some of the most useful command line arugments for moving around a file system using the command line interface
